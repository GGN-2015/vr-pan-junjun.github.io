abstract: "This paper describes an interactive dissection approach for hybrid soft tissue models governed by position-based dynamics. Our framework makes use of a hybrid geometric model comprising both surface and volumetric meshes. The fine surface triangular mesh is used to represent the exterior structure of soft tissue models. Meanwhile, the interior structure of soft tissues is constructed by coarser tetrahedral meshes, which are also employed as physical models participating in dynamic simulation. The less details of interior structure can effectively reduce the computational cost of deformation and geometric subdivision during dissection. For physical deformation, we design and implement a position-based dynamics approach that supports topology modification and enforces the volume-preserving constraint. Experimental results have shown that, this hybrid dissection method affords real-time and robust cutting simulation without sacrificing realistic visual performance."
