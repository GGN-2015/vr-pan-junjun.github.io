abstract: "2D caricature editing has shown superior performance. However, 3D exaggerated caricature face (ECF) modeling with flexible shape and texture editing capabilities is far from achieving satisfactory high-quality results. This paper aims to model shape and texture variations of 3D caricatures in a learnable parameter space. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel framework for highly controllable editing of 3D caricatures. Our model mainly consists of the texture and shape hyper-networks, texture and shape Sirens, and a projection module. Specifically, two hyper-networks take the texture and shape latent codes as inputs to learn the compact parameter spaces of the two Siren modules. The texture and shape Sirens are leveraged to model the deformation variations of textural styles and geometric shapes. We further incorporate precise control of the camera parameters in the projection module to enhance the quality of generated ECF results. Our method allows flexible editing online and swapping textural features between 3D caricatures. For this purpose, we contribute a 3D caricature face dataset with textures for training and testing. Experiments and user evaluations demonstrate that our method is capable of generating diverse high-fidelity caricatures and achieves better editing capabilities than state-of-the-art methods."
