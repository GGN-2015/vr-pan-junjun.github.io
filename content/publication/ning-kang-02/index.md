abstract: "The rapid generation and flexible reuse of characters animation by commodity devices are of significant importance to rich digital content production in virtual reality. This paper aims to handle the challenges of current motion imitation for human body in several indoor scenes (e.g., fitness training). We develop a real-time system based on single Kinect device, which is able to capture stable human motions and retarget to virtual characters. A large variety of motions and characters are tested to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our system."
