abstract: "The mesh deformation are composed of two components: deformation by normal balls and deformation by joint balls. Normal balls are generated using sphere-tree construction toolkit (Bradshaw et al [TOG04]). The sizes and positions are modified using the method proposed by Pan et al [VC15]. The joint balls are created at the joints of the skeleton, and the radius is set manually."
